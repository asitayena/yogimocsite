She is obviously an American by nationality but her ethnic background is mixed – Afro-American from her father’s side and Caucasian from her mum’s part of the family. She was given the full name, Michelle Grace Harry at birth.</p><p>Grace has never disclosed the names of her parent in the public space but reports have it that she was born to a teenage mother. Her mum was 17 when she had her and as a result of the challenges of raising a child at a young age, she (her mother) decided to put her through foster homes, but they eventually reunited.</p><p>In an interview session with ThinkCommon, by American actor and rap artist known as Common, Grace said her separation with her biological mum came to an end after a short while; she didn’t specify the length of time.</p><p>Talking about her father, Grace Harry described him as an activist who had to spend time behind bars. The kind of crime that sent him to prison is not known but he battled addiction to hard substances. With a teenage mother and a father that did time in jail, Grace experienced a highly challenging childhood but she was raised to be a Christian and has upheld the Christian faith to date.</p><p>While we know a bit about her background, we know nothing about the details of Grace’s academic journey.</p><h2><strong>How did Grace Harry and Usher Meet</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/R-2-e1690056518399.jpg><p>The details of how Grace Harry met Usher for the first time are not known, but according to reports, the duo started having a romantic relationship as far back as September 2009. It was during this period that they were first sited together in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>It was revealed that the couple have an eight-year-long age gap between them with Grace as the older partner, but that didn’t stop them from falling in love. In January 2015, their relationship became the talk of the town after it was reported that Usher popped the big question to his love interest, Grace. Considering the fact that they have always kept everything about their love life under wraps, fans expected them to have a private wedding and that was exactly the case.</p><h3><strong>The Couple Wedded in September 2015</strong></h3><p>The prediction of Usher’s fans came to pass in September 2015 when news broke that he had exchanged wedding vows with Grace Harry in a private wedding ceremony. As new reports unfolded, it was revealed that they had their wedding ceremony in Cuba; this was confirmed by Usher when he appeared on the set of Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p><p>Tameka Foster, Usher’s first wife, never got along with Grace. When Grace showed up at her home, she actually spat on her. The case ended up in court where Tameka confessed to pushing her ex-husband out of the way because she was ”extremely upset” when he was making an attempt to move her and even referred to Grace as his mistress.</p><h3><strong>What Happened to Usher and Grace?</strong></h3><p>The marriage between Grace and her husband, Usher, was barely three years old when they decided to go their separate ways. Reports had it that it was the American musician who filed for divorce from Grace.</p><p>The couple later announced their impending separation in a joint statement when they let their fans know that the decision to split was a mutual one and there were no hard feelings from either party.</p><p>The couple also said they would remain connected in a bid to nurture their friendship and shared love, and would continue lending each other support as they enter the next phase of their lives.</p><p>Grace Harry and Usher’s divorce news broke months after Usher’s name hit the airwave for infecting three people with herpes virus without their knowledge. Usher was eventually slammed with three lawsuits from one man and two women who came up with claims that they had sexual encounters with him several years ago and that it was during those encounters that he passed down the virus to them. The plaintiffs kept their identities private throughout the case</p><p>During Usher’s tying time at the court, Harry was a pillar of support for him, and with the kind of united front they presented at the court, fans really thought their marriage was set to last longer, but their separation in 2018 came as a rude shock to many.</p><p>On the real reason behind their divorce, it was reported that Grace wanted them to have kids via surrogacy but the American musician was opposed to the idea as he preferred adoption.</p><h3><strong>How many Children Does Grace harry Have?</strong></h3><p>Reports show that Grace Harry has two children and they came from her previous relationships before crossing paths with Usher.</p><p>Her daughter goes by the name Leaf McLean and works in the entertainment industry as a musician.
