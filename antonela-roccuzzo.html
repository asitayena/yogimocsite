She was shy as a kid. Accordingly, she did not have many friends during her early years.</p><p>Besides, she was friends with Lionel Messi since she was five years old. Since then, the two have been liking each other.</p><p>Antonela went to Centro Educativo Latinoamericano for her school-level education.

Again, unsure of her destination, she switched her education to social communication. She finally acquired a college degree in it.</p><p>But life did not take her towards it. Later, she altered her desire and started seeking a career in modeling. Many celebrities’ wives or girlfriends call their life’s goals accomplished as soon as they hook up with them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Antonela-And-family-Source-Instagram-2-1.jpg><p>However, Roccuzzo was not one of them.

Messi has been playing for the Spanish giants FC Barcelona for a couple of decades now.</p><p>With his awareness and exceptional skills on the pitch, he has become arguably the greatest footballing history player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lionel-Messi-playing-in-2020-21-La-Liga-season.jpg><p>Messi has won the Ballon d’Or, the greatest award for a footballer, for a record six times in his career. His fierce rival, Cristiano Ronaldo, has got five of them.</p><p>Besides, Messi has six golden boot awards on his shelf. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ansu Fati</strong></a> is the kid who is expected to fill his shoes after his departure.</p><h3>Early Days</h3><p>Leo was born on June 24, 1987, to <strong>Jorge Messi</strong> and <strong>Celia Cuccittini.</strong> He was born in Rosario, the same town as Antonela.</p><p>As early as the age of four, he joined a local club Grandoli.

Later, he joined the Rosario club Newell’s Old Boys when he was six.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lionel-Messi-in-his-young-age.jpg><p>His future received a massive threat as he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency at ten. Later in 2000, FC Barcelona offered a contract on napkin paper.</p><p>In Barcelona’s early days, his teammates thought he was mute as he did not speak much. Eventually, his growth hormone treatment ended when he was 14.</p><p><strong>Read More About More Players <a href=# rel=noopener>Julie Ertz: Bio, Husband, Net Worth & Career>></a></strong></p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Messi was included in the first team in 2003. But his starting eleven appearances came in 2005 when he signed a contract as a senior team player. He paired with <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronaldinho</a></strong> and <strong>Samuel Eto’o</strong> to form a deadly attack trio.</p><p>The man signed a contract in 2008 that made him the club’s highest-paid player. He received the number 10 shirt after the departure of Ronaldinho. With the new manager <strong>Pep Guardiola,</strong> he played as a false nine.</p><p>The club beat Manchester United 2-0 at the 2009 UEFA Champions League final in Rome. Two seasons later, both the club met again at the same stage. Again, with Messi’s match-winning goal, Barcelona came on top with a 3-1 victory.</p><p>In 2012, Messi became the highest goal-scorer in the history of FC Barcelona. Notably, he broke the record for most goals in a calendar year in 2012 with 91 goals.</p><h4>Key Barca Man</h4><p>With upcoming seasons underway, Messi became more and more vital for the team. Along with<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>Neymar Jr.</strong></a> and Luis Suarez forming a deadly <strong>MSN trio,</strong> he secured another Champions League for the 2014-2015 season.</p><p>He reached the FIFA World Cup 2014 final with his Argentine national team. However, the Germans showed him a bitter loss in late extra time. Messi recorded 41 goals and 23 assists in the 2015-2016 season, winning both domestic titles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lionel-Messi-smiles-with-2014-15-UEFA-Champions-League-trophy.jpg><p>The next season brought only a single title, Copa del Rey. He scored his 100th UEFA club goal in the 2017-18 clash against Olympiacos. The season he signed a new contract with FC Barcelona to see him at the club until 2020-21.</p><h4>Barca Captain</h4><p>Messi became the new captain of the club following the departure of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Andres Iniesta</strong></a> in 2018. He scored his 400th league goal in January.</p><p>With a tragic loss against<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sadio Mane</a>‘s Liverpool, he had to bow out from the Champions League that season too. However, the club was able to clinch the La Liga title.</p><p>In the 2019-20 season, he broke Cristiano Ronaldo’s record for most Spanish league goals. He ended the season with 25 goals and 21 assists.</p><p>The 8-2 loss against <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Robert Lewandowski</strong></a><strong>’s</strong> FC Bayern Munich was his worst defeat as a player. Unfortunately, Barcelona had to face a titleless season.</p><h4>Club Exit desires</h4><p>Following the end of the 2019-20 season, Messi openly desired to leave the club he played for two decades. This produced a massive wave in sports and social media.</p><p>The club declined his transfer request calling his contract did not let him leave after June. Ultimately, he had to remain at the club for at least a year.</p><h2>Antonela Roccuzzo | Relationship And Kids</h2><h3>How Antonela’s Relationship With Messi Started?</h3><p>Antonela and Lionel have known each other since Antonela’s age of five. Messi was a childhood friend of Antonela’s cousin, Lucas Scaglia. They two met in 1996 when Messi played for the Newell’s Old Boys with Lucas.</p><p>They spent a long time of day at the shore of the Parana River. However, the news about the early relationship did not get out of the close circle. It took Messi to be 21 years of age to make the public aware of their affair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Antonela-Roccuzzo-with-Lionel-Messi-as-kids..jpg><p>Antonela lost her heart to the <strong>GOAT</strong> as he flew to Rosario in 2007 to consolidate their relationship. At that time, her closest friend had died in a traffic accident.</p><p>That was the best care she could receive from a man with a busy schedule in Europe’s top-flight leagues.</p><h3>In Front Of The Public Eyes</h3><p>Soon they revealed their relationship, and of course, that raised a wave in the media. Soon Antonela traveled to Barcelona to move in with Messi. Later, she cheered for her man at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.</p><p>The couple gave birth to their eldest son <strong>Thiago</strong> in 2012. Messi celebrated a goal in Argentina’s 4-0 win against Ecuador in June 2012 by placing the ball under his shirt.</p><p>In football, it is a gesture to celebrate one’s fiancée’s pregnancy. Later, in 2015, they welcomed their second child <strong>Mateo.</strong></p><h3>Wedding</h3><p>Antonela and Lionel finally decided to tie the knot of marriage on June 30, 2017. After the end of the regular football season, the couple was married in Rosario, Argentina. Luis Suarez, <strong><a href=#>Neymar Jr</a>., Gerard Pique, Shakira,</strong> and <strong>Cesc Fabregas</strong> were notable attendees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Antonela-Roccuzzo-and-Lionel-Messi-wedding.jpg><p>According to sources, there were 260 guests present. Again, in March 2018, the newly married couple had their third son, <strong>Ciro.</strong> Messi took a bit of time off the pitch to be with his family on each occasion.</p><h3>Relationships Other Than Messi</h3><p>While Messi was pursuing his career in Barcelona, Antonela fell in love with someone else. However, the relationship did not last for long. The details about the affair, including the name, are still under the radar.</p><p>But the important issue is that it did not ruin the beautiful relationship between Messi and Antonela. Eventually, she dumped the man only for Messi. Messi re-won her heart by being with her when she faced the grief of her friend’s death.</p><h2>Antonela Roccuzzo | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>Being the wife of the GOAT in football history will certainly attract a lot of fortune to her.</p><p>Antonela has gathered significant wealth from her modeling and endorsement deals. Besides, she partnered with Suarez’s wife, Sofia, to open the footwear brand, Sarkany.</p><p>Antonela Roccuzzo has a net worth of around <strong>$20 million</strong> as of 2023.</p><p>Her husband, Messi, is the highest-paid athlete in the world. He earns <strong>$35 million</strong> a year only from the club’s contract.</p><p>Including endorsements and marketing, his earnings will surpass many of the players in the world. Overall, Messi has a net worth of <strong>$400 million</strong> as of 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Antonela-Roccuzzo-enjoying-vacations-with-Messi-and-their-kids.jpg><p>However, Antonela is not dependent on her husband for her needs. She can live an independent life on her own. But the exact figure of her earnings is not known.</p><p>Likewise, she lives with her husband and kids in a lavish house in the coastal town of Castelldefels. It is situated 25 km southwest of the main Barcelona city.</p><p>When talking about Messi’s activities at home besides sports, Antonela in one of the interviews spoke that Messi at “Home does not speak neither of football neither fashionable, see the TV”.</p><h2>2022 Update</h2><p>Recently the couple was seen celebrating their son’s birthday, Thiago, which is on November 8, 2022</p><p>Which makes him 21 years old.</p><h2>Antonela Roccuzzo | Social Media</h2><p>Antonela is a great sensation on Instagram. Meanwhile, it is the only social media handle she uses, as she stated in her Instagram bio.
