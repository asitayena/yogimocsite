Continue the conversation | sarah.sharples@news.com.au</b></i></p><p>Initial estimates show the company owes between $10 million and $20 million to creditors and Mr Gammel said they were looking for a buyer or to protect the interest of creditors as much as possible to ensure they got a return on their money.</p><p>“We are happy to talk to all the parties around the opportunity and it does have some infrastructure set up. But getting someone to come in to acquire these types of things, we have seen it’s difficult at the moment with other examples, but we are doing everything we can to go and find someone,” he added.</p><p>“It’s very early in the process. We are going through our normal approach and keeping everyone up to date. It’s obviously a unique trading environment at the moment so we are doing everything we can to see where we will get to over the next phase of the process.”</p><p>In2food, which also previously traded as Yarra Valley Farms Australia, collapsed back in August 2021 blaming the “disruption of snap lockdowns in multiple states” and a “problematic retail journey” into ready to eat meals.</p><p>The company had a deal with David Jones to supply ready-to-eat meals to BP service stations, which failed.</p><p>The business had distributed fresh farm foods to supermarkets, hospitals, aged care, retailers, airlines and restaurants and had sites in every part of Australia except Tasmania.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Documents released in September 2021 revealed the company owed $53 million to creditors, including small businesses.</p><p>It continued to trade while in administration and was thrown a lifeline in October 2021 when it was bought by Produce Republic – the owner of Aussie Frozen Fruit – which also saved 400 jobs.</p><p>The company was sold site unseen due to travel restrictions preventing the new owners from conducting a national tour of plants in person to inspect equipment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S8tbTEq2SippSqwLW%2ByJ6qaJmlqMGzrcuimKdlmaN%2Fp7vOnWScp52lrq%2FFjJympaSRpcCmv4yfpqtlo5qwsLrDZquipZVixKrAx2ZpaaVdnrtusMSbq2ZpYGV9bq%2FRnpuirJ%2BnwHC6xLCqZqukpL%2B6e5Kba59vlmqxprKQnGtpaZRnhKWDlpyZnGmUa4Z5rcFu</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faustralian-in2food-company-collapses-for-second-time-with-20m-in-debt-1000-creditors.html&text=Australian%20In2Food%20company%20collapses%20for%20second%20time%20with%20%2420m%20in%20debt%2c%201000%20creditors&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faustralian-in2food-company-collapses-for-second-time-with-20m-in-debt-1000-creditors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faustralian-in2food-company-collapses-for-second-time-with-20m-in-debt-1000-creditors.html&title=Australian%20In2Food%20company%20collapses%20for%20second%20time%20with%20%2420m%20in%20debt%2c%201000%20creditors" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faustralian-in2food-company-collapses-for-second-time-with-20m-in-debt-1000-creditors.html&title=Australian%20In2Food%20company%20collapses%20for%20second%20time%20with%20%2420m%20in%20debt%2c%201000%20creditors" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faustralian-in2food-company-collapses-for-second-time-with-20m-in-debt-1000-creditors.html&title=Australian%20In2Food%20company%20collapses%20for%20second%20time%20with%20%2420m%20in%20debt%2c%201000%20creditors" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faustralian-in2food-company-collapses-for-second-time-with-20m-in-debt-1000-creditors.html&description=Australian%20In2Food%20company%20collapses%20for%20second%20time%20with%20%2420m%20in%20debt%2c%201000%20creditors" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./awkwafina-net-worth-2020-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Awkwafina Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Kids, Bio-Wiki">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./andrew-andrews.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andrew Andrews">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
