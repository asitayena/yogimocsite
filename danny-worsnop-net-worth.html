Previously, he was the lead singer of Asking Alexandria, a metalcore band. Beside that, he is also recognized as a solo artist. His career has been active since 2008.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Danny Worsnop is? It has been estimated by authoritative sources that the total size of Danny’s net worth is over $2 million, as of mid- 2016, most of his wealth is the result of his successful career in the music industry as a singer, and member of two bands. Additionally to this, he has collaborated with such artists as With One Last Breath, Memphis May Fire, and I See Stars, which also increased his net worth. Other sources are coming from his careers as an actor, and an author.</p><h3>Danny Worsnop Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Danny Worsnop was raised with his younger sister in the village of Gilberdyke in Yorkshire by his parents Philip and Sharon Worsnop. When he was eight years old he began taking violin classes, and then he became a member of the local orchestra. Further information about his education is unavailable.</p><p>Danny also learnt to play guitar and bass, and in his teens he became a member of the metalcore band Asking Alexandria, and his musical career officially began in 2008, with the band’s debut album released in the following year under the title “Stand Up And Scream”, produced by Joey Sturgis. Although the album didn’t enter the charts in the UK and USA, it reached No. 4 on the Top Heatseekers and No. 24 on the Top Hard Rock Albums charts, which increased his net worth to a large degree. The band’s second album entitled “Reckless & Relentless” was released in 2011, reaching No. 7 on the UK Rock Chart, and No. 30 on the Australian Albums Chart. The band’s third and last album was released in 2013, named “From Death To Destiny”, which was very successful, increasing further his net worth, as it topped the Top Hard Rock Albums chart.</p><p>In 2015 Danny left the band Asking Alexandria, as four years previously he had formed his own band named We Are Harlot. He released their debut single “Denial” in 2014, and in the following year was released the band’s debut self-titled studio album, reaching No. 165 in the US, and No. 58 in the UK, adding further to his net worth.</p><p>Furthermore, Danny is also known as a solo artist, as he will release his debut solo album “The Long Road Home” in 2016, and for the first single from album, named “I Got Bones”, a music video has been made. His net worth will certainly increase.</p><p>Apart from his successful career as a singer, Danny has tried himself in other business ventures, such as in acting, as he made his debut appearance in the film “What Now” (2015), directed by Ash Avildsen, followed by the role of The Smith in the film “Alleluia! The Devil’s Carnival” in the same year. Beside that, he has also published his autobiographical book “Am I Insane?”, which also contributed to his net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Danny Worsnop was engaged to model Markie McManus, the status of the relationship being currently unknown. Additionally to his career, he is very active on social media platforms, including official Twitter and Instagram accounts.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjp2Yp6apYsSwvtKnpqllnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdanny-worsnop-net-worth.html&text=Danny%20Worsnop%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdanny-worsnop-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-worsnop-net-worth.html&title=Danny%20Worsnop%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdanny-worsnop-net-worth.html&title=Danny%20Worsnop%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-worsnop-net-worth.html&title=Danny%20Worsnop%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdanny-worsnop-net-worth.html&description=Danny%20Worsnop%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dreary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Dreary>&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./claudia-winkleman-halloween-child-injury.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Claudia Winkleman's Halloween heartbreak over rarely-seen daughter Matilda">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
