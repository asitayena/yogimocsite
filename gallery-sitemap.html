They accused the production of not properly following safety protocols, including gun inspections. The workers claimed that there were two accidental gun discharges on set before, with Baldwin’s stunt double allegedly firing a gun that was announced as “cold” only to find a live round in it.“There should have been an investigation into what happened,” a crew member alleged to the LA Times. “There were no safety meetings. There was no assurance that it wouldn’t happen again. All they wanted to do was rush, rush, rush.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shutterstock_editorial_10332078bk.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[How Did Other Sets React?]]>&lt;![CDATA[Many film and TV sets are taking action and vowing not to risk having “hot” or “live” meaning loaded weapons on set.

During a September 2021 episode of the “Voices of West” podcast, the former model admitted “the best part” of her job was “just showing people who are normally kind of freaked out by guns how safe they can be and how they’re not really problematic unless put in the wrong hands.”Reed is the daughter of longtime armorer Thell Reed, who was Brad Pitt’s shooting coach on the 2007 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. However, the 24-year-old had only worked on one movie before landing the role of head armorer on Baldwin's western.The Hollywood rookie noted she had “figured” out most of the job's requirements on “my own” and said that “loading blanks” is the “scariest thing to me.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Halyna-Hutchins-memorial-after-Rust-shooting.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[The Armorer Says She 'Has No Idea' Why Live Rounds Were in the Gun]]>&lt;![CDATA[Gutierrez Reed's lawyers, Jason Bowles and Robert Gorence, released a statement to Us in October 2021."First Hannah would like to extend her deepest and most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Halyna," the statement read, referring to Hutchins as "an inspirational woman in film who Hannah looked up to."The statement went on to allege that she had been "slandered" in the aftermath of the shooting."Safety is Hannah’s number one priority on set. Ultimately this set would never have been compromised if live ammo were not introduced," the lawyers claimed on her behalf. "Hannah has no idea where the live rounds came from. Hannah and the prop master gained control over the guns and she never witnessed anyone shoot live rounds with these guns and nor would she permit that. They were locked up every night and at lunch and there’s no way a single one of them was unaccounted for or being shot by crew members. Hannah still, to this day, has never had an accidental discharge."Though there have been reports that there were two accidental discharges in other situations on set, Gutierrez Reed's lawyers allege that others were at fault. "The first one on this set was the prop master and the second was a stunt man after Hannah informed him his gun was hot with blanks," they alleged.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Halyna-Hutchins-memorial-after-Alec-Baldwin-movie-shooting.jpg?quality=55&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[The Armorer Wanted More Time to Prepare]]>&lt;![CDATA[Gutierrez Reed's lawyers suggested that the blame for the fatal accident lay with other filmmakers."Hannah was hired on two positions on this film, which made it extremely difficult to focus on her job as an armorer," they said in the October 2021 statement. "She fought for training, days to maintain weapons, and proper time to prepare for gunfire but ultimately was overruled by production and her department. The whole production set became unsafe due to various factors, including lack of safety meetings. This was not the fault of Hannah."]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rust-shooting-Alec-Baldwin-statement.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Baldwin Says Hutchins Was a Friend]]>&lt;![CDATA[While in Vermont in October 2021, Baldwin told news outlets that he couldn't say much about the incident, but he is cooperating with authorities and mourning the death of Hutchins."I’ve been ordered by the sheriff’s department in Santa Fe, I can’t answer any questions about the investigation," Baldwin said.

Davis’ post, which the actor shared via his Instagram account on November 2, claimed “the story being spun of us being overworked and surrounded by unsafe, chaotic conditions is bullst.”Davis stated that she “never worked more than a 12.5-hour shoot day,” saying that only happened once and “most days” were under the 12-hour mark. She recalled the day that Hutchins died, saying, “We had come off a 12-hour turnaround after an 11-hour shoot day,” noting they had a “56-hour weekend right before” the prolonged day. “No one was too tired to do their jobs,” she said.She refuted claims that the producers on the film didn’t care about their crew, writing, “They were some of the most approachable and warm producers I’ve ever worked with.” Davis explained that “concerns were heard and addressed” by the producers. According to her, the crew had a union rep who told production “not to give in to the camera crew” demands because they were asking for things that “the union does not require.”Davis alleged that she has spoken with the producers on the project since the accident, and they told her they have chosen not to defend themselves against the “blatantly false accusations” because they want the “focus to be on Halyna” and they want to “grieve and recover.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Alec-Baldwin-Hollywood-Needs-Police-Officers-Set-After-Rust-Tragedy-0001.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Police Protection?]]>&lt;![CDATA[“Every film/TV set that uses guns, fake or otherwise, should have a police officer on set, hired by the production, to specifically monitor weapons safety,” Baldwin tweeted in November 2021.

In a clip from the December 2021 special, Baldwin cried while reflecting on what went wrong on set."The trigger wasn't pulled. I didn't pull the trigger," he said. "I would never point a gun at anyone and pull the trigger at them. Never. I have no idea [how a bullet got in there]. Someone put a live bullet in a gun.

I don't say that lightly."He continued to deny pulling the trigger, asserting that he was simply following Hutchins' directions on set.

The writers of the note clarified that the note had "not been sanctioned or influenced in any way by the producers,” but was intended to "express a more accurate account" of their "workplace tragedy." The letter stated that Hutchins was the “heart of the production” and “losing her hurt every single one of us." "We are hurting from the loss of our togetherness, our spirit, and the loss of our labor,” the message continued. “We are hurting for our friends that have been targeted by the public as they themselves grieve." While those who worked on the film said the production had its challenges, “the descriptions of Rust as a chaotic, dangerous, and exploitative workplace are false and distract from what matters the most: the memory of Halyna Hutchins, and the need to find modern alternatives to outdated industry firearm and safety practices.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Investigation-Continues-Alec-Baldwin-Rust-Prop-Gun-Misfire-Everything-to-Know.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[The Investigation Continues]]>&lt;![CDATA[Police sought a warrant to obtain the Boss Baby actor's cell phone in December 2021, according to Deadline, requesting the device to determine whether there might be "any evidence relating to the death investigation of Halyna Hutchins."

"This, in fact is a lie," he tweeted in December 2021. "The choices regarding any props by me for the film RUST were made weeks before production began. To suggest that any changes were made 'before fatal shooting' is false."]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alec-Baldwin-Thanks-Supporters-Amid-Tough-Time-After-Rust-Shooting.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Alec's Christmas Message]]>&lt;![CDATA[Baldwin took to Instagram on Christmas Eve 2021 to thank “all the people who sent me such kind words and best wishes and strength and hope and prayers, thoughts and lots of encouragement.”He said in the December 24 video, ”I got hundreds, hundreds of emails from friends, family and colleagues and people I haven't heard from in quite a while to send me strength and good wishes and so forth. I'm really grateful to them.”The actor then referenced the tragedy. “I’m looking forward to some aspects of this being behind me, of course. For everyone who is involved in this, it'll never be behind us because someone died so tragically,” he said. “I only care about my wife and my kids and moving forward with my life and trying to get through a tough time, a really tough time.

Our thoughts and prayers remain with Halyna’s family.”]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alec-Baldwin-Reacts-News-Halyna-Hutchins-Death-New-Footage-002.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Video From the Day]]>&lt;![CDATA[In April 2022, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department released all files related to the investigation of the shooting.

However, an FBI forensic report obtained by ABC News in August 2022 reportedly stated that the gun Baldwin was using was evaluated in various positions.With the hammer at various angles including quarter-, half- and fully cocked positions the gun "could not be made to fire without a pull of the trigger while the working internal components were intact and functional," the report stated.With the hammer de-cocked on a loaded chamber, the gun was able to detonate a primer "without a pull of the trigger when the hammer was struck directly," which is normal for a Pietta .45 Colt type of revolver, the report stated.In a bullet, the primer is the small explosive charge that ignites the propellant, which creates the chemical reaction that pushes the bullet core out.]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-Could-Gun-Be-Fired-If-Baldwin-Didnt-Pull-Trigger-0001.jpg?quality=47&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[How Could the Gun Be Fired If Baldwin Didn't Pull the Trigger?]]>&lt;![CDATA[In an August 16 interview with Chris Cuomo, Baldwin doubled down on his stance that he did not pull the trigger."This did not come from me, this came from the D.A.'s Office themselves," the actor began. "You're familiar with what fanning a gun is? Have you heard of that phrase, 'fanning the gun'? So, if you pull the hammer back, and you don’t lock the hammer ... if you pull the hammer back pretty far in old Western movies you’d see someone fan the hammer of the gun the hammer didn’t lock; you pulled it back to an extent where it would fire the bullet without you pulling the trigger, without you locking the hammer."He further emphasized: "The person who was the principal safety officer of the film declared, in front of the entire assemblage, 'This is a cold gun.'"]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Alec-Baldwin-Rust-0001.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[New Mexico District Attorney Considers Criminal Charges]]>&lt;![CDATA[Santa Fe Dist.

We are grateful to everyone who contributed to the resolution of this tragic and painful situation,” he said.Production of Rust is set to resume in January 2023.

In court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight, the actor's lawyers argued that Reeb cannot be both a state lawmaker and a special prosecutor because of the state constitution’s separation of powers provision.“Doing so vests two core powers of different branches legislating and prosecuting in the same person, and is thus barred by the plain language of Article III of the New Mexico Constitution," the motion argues before outlining what could allegedly happen in the future if Reeb is allowed to continue as the prosecutor. “Future District Attorneys could seek to curry favor with legislators who control their budgets by appointing them to high-profile cases. ... At the same time, allowing a single person to exercise both legislative and prosecutorial power could taint prosecutorial decision-making."]]>https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Alec-Baldwin-Rust-Shooting-Everything-to-Know-2.jpg?quality=86&strip=all&lt;![CDATA[Who Are Halyna Hutchins Parent’s Suing?]]>&lt;![CDATA[Hutchins' parents, Anatolii Androsovych and Olga Solovey, and sister Svetlana Zemko, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on February 8, 2023, against Baldwin, assistant director David Halls, armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and Rust Movie Productions, LLC, according to NBC News.The allegations against the defendants included battery, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium.
