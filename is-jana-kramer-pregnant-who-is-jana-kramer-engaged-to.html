Over the course of four years, he made sixty league appearances for the club. Following his time at Hamilton Academical, Russell went on to play for several renowned teams in the UK, including St. Mirren, Macclesfield Town, Mansfield Town, and Airdrie. In 2008, he caught the attention of Scottish Premier League clubs and eventually signed with Kilmarnock.</p><p>After his contract with Kilmarnock concluded, Russell ventured across the Atlantic and joined the Carolina RailHawks, an American football league team, in July 2010. He represented the North Carolina-based team for one year before moving on to play for the Orange County Blues FC in California. During his time there, he showcased his skills as both a defensive midfielder and a striker until 2014.</p><p>Transitioning from player to coach, Russell joined the England national team’s staff as a striker coach in March 2017. His coaching abilities received recognition and acclaim, particularly after an impressive goal scored during the team’s match against Panama in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Jana first encountered Gambino as a teenager and was captivated by his smooth-talking and seemingly charming demeanor, despite the significant age gap between them. They hastily married after only two weeks of dating, but their union swiftly turned toxic.</p><p>Jana bravely recounted the horrifying experiences of abuse she endured during their marriage. Gambino subjected her to both physical and emotional harm, instilling deep fear for her safety. To escape his violent outbursts, she resorted to sleeping in her car or hiding in bushes. Gambino’s behavior fluctuated between moments of extreme aggression, where he would yell and inflict physical harm, and periods of false affection and normalcy the following day. One particularly disturbing incident etched in Jana’s memory was when Gambino sent her a threatening photo of her dogs on the freeway, warning of harm if she didn’t return home.</p><p>The abuse inflicted severe psychological damage on Jana, eroding her self-confidence with each instance of mistreatment. She felt trapped in a cycle of abuse, constantly yearning for change but finding herself back in his embrace despite the torment she endured. Jana concealed her bruises with makeup, masking the physical evidence of her suffering from the outside world.</p><p>Eventually, Jana summoned the strength to break free from the abusive relationship, and they divorced mere months after their wedding. However, the traumatic memories persisted, and Jana vividly recalled the night when Gambino choked her until she lost consciousness, leaving her bruised and bleeding outside their home. Reaching her breaking point, she pleaded for an escape from her miserable circumstances.</p><p>Gambino faced consequences for his abusive actions. He was convicted of attempted murder and received a six-year prison sentence. After his release in 2010, Gambino tragically took his own life in 2012, bringing an end to his troubled journey.</p><p>Jana Kramer’s experience with Michael Gambino represents a painful chapter in her life, characterized by abuse, fear, and the arduous struggle to break free. However, she has since discovered strength and resilience, using her voice to raise awareness about the devastating impact of domestic violence. Jana aims to inspire others who may find themselves in similar situations to seek help and find the courage to break free from the vicious cycle of abuse.</p><h2><span id=How_Many_Times_has_Jana_Kramer_Been_Married>How Many Times has Jana Kramer Been Married?</span></h2><p>Jana Kramer has been married twice in her life. Following her divorce from Michael Gambino, she met actor Johnathon Schaech. In a candid episode of her podcast, Whine Down, Jana Kramer opened up about her previous marriage to Schaech. The couple, who tied the knot in 2010, reflected on their relationship and the reasons behind their separation. Jana revealed that they were both individuals carrying emotional baggage and seeking to fill voids in their lives.</p><p>She admitted that she had a need for love that Schaech couldn’t fulfill. They both acknowledged the necessity of focusing on their personal growth and healing independently. Schaech disclosed that he hadn’t fully recovered from his previous marriage to Christina Applegate when he entered into a relationship with Kramer. Lingering feelings for Applegate impacted their relationship, and he even confessed to accidentally using Applegate’s name when addressing Jana.</p><p>The podcast episode also touched on a dark period in Jana Kramer’s life, during which Schaech provided support. Initially, he was not receptive to her apology, but years later, he reached out to offer support and condolences when she faced challenges in her marriage to Mike Caussin. Reflecting on this gesture, Jana expressed gratitude and described Schaech and his wife, Julie Solomon, as family. Listeners can find the episode on iHeartRadio podcasts for further insights.</p><p>Kramer and Schaech divorced just a month after their wedding in 2010. Schaech previously discussed the failed marriage in a Reddit AMA in December 2020 and later shared a wedding photo on Twitter, explaining it to his son. The tweet sparked a conversation between Jana Kramer and Mike Caussin on her podcast, as she expressed discomfort with the post.</p><p>However, during the recent podcast episode featuring Schaech, they found closure and humor in their past, even joking about unblocking each other on Instagram. Both expressed respect and appreciation for one another, emphasizing that they have moved on and are on good terms. Schaech has a son named Camden with his wife, Julie Solomon, and Jana Kramer shares two children, Jolie Rae and Jace Joseph, with Mike Caussin.</p><h2><span id=How_Old_is_Jana_Kramer>How Old is&nbsp;Jana Kramer?</span></h2><p>As of 2023, Jana Kramer is 39 years old.
