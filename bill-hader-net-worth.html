Raised alongside two younger sisters, Bill struggled to focus in school and was constantly joking around. Instead of focusing on his studies, he spent his time reading books and watching movies as a child. Some of his earliest influences were Monty Python movies and films by <a href=# title="Woody Allen Net Worth">Woody Allen</a>. During his high school days, he made short films with his friends and starred in a stage production of "The Glass Menagerie."</p><p>Due to his poor grades, he was rejected by the best film schools in the country. Eventually, he was accepted by The Art Institute of Phoenix and later studied at Scottsdale Community College. During this period, Hader worked odd jobs such as selling Christmas trees and acting as an usher at cinemas.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-353413 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Bill-Hader.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-353413 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Emma McIntyre/FilmMagic)</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>At a certain point, Bill Hader dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles, intent on starting a career as a filmmaker. His parents allowed him to use the money they had put aside for his education while living in Los Angeles. He soon found work as a production assistant and aimed to become an assistant director.

Eventually, he quit after pulling a 20-hour day on the set of "The Scorpion King."</p><p>Things started to go downhill for Hader. He started working in a post-production facility and created his own short film, which he considered a failure. Next, he and his long-term girlfriend broke up.
