Besides that, the 71-year-old grew up with his brother, <strong>Ray Jones,</strong> who currently coaches a minor league team.</p><p>Moving on to his education, Hamilton attended the University of Tennessee at Martin.</p><p>During his time there, Leonard played basketball for the college team. Also, the 71-year-old was a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity,</p><h2>Leonard Hamilton: Career</h2><p>When we talk about Leonard’s career, it is synonymous with success.</p><p>Starting in 1971 as the assistant coach of Austin Peay State University, Leonard slowly progressed through the ranks until he got his big break with the University of Kentuck in 1974.</p><p>During Hamilton’s eight years with the team, he won the NCAA Championship in 1978 and finished&nbsp;as runner-up in 1975, and reached the Final Four in 1984.</p><p>Thereafter, Leonard took the first head coach role of his career with the Oklahoma State University in 1986.</p><p>During his four years, the 71-year-old guided the Oklahoma State Cowboys to 7th, 6th, 4th, and 5th, respectively.</p><p>Subsequently, Hamilton managed the University of Miami’s Miami Hurricanes for a decade.</p><p>Moreover, Leonard guided his team to the postseason five times with an appearance in the NCAA Sweet 16 being the farthest stage they could manage.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karl Malone Net Worth: Bio, Contracts, Salary, House, Wife, Children Wiki >></a></strong></p><h3>Leonard Hamilton: Washinton Wizards</h3><p>In the year 2000, Hamilton got the call to manage the Washington Wizards franchise in the NBA.</p><p>However, it was not the NBA that lured him to the Wizards. Instead, it was the opportunity to manage the GOAT of basketball, <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>.</p><p>Although the 2000-2001 season did not pan out the way both parties would have liked, nonetheless, Hamilton gained valuable experience that would come in handy later on in his career.</p><h3>Florida State University</h3><p>Ever since Leonard left the Washington Wizards, he has managed the Florida State University’s men’s basketball team. In other words, the 71-year-old has been working there for 18 years.</p><p>Likewise, in those years, Hamilton has won three National Coach of the Year awards and managed 15 postseason appearances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chelsea-1102.jpg><p>Added to that, he is also the 7th winningest coach in the history of the ACC.
