Rodney tries to end his life early after learning that he has terminal cancer but changes his mind at the last minute. Without knowing what to do next, Rodney makes the decision to start living a little, doing what he wants and doing good in the world. The 2022 movie, which was directed by Oliver Hermanus, is based on Akira Kurosawa’s 1952 drama film “Ikiru” (translated as “To Live” in English). This uplifting and motivational movie instills in its viewers the importance of leading a decent life since at the end of the day, that’s all anyone has. Here are a few more suggestions that we think you might like if the perspective on life through death that the story offers piques your interest. The majority of these films like “Living” are available on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, Hulu, or Amazon Prime.</p><h3>50/50 (2011)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/50-50.jpg alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" width=512 height=341 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the movie “50/50,” Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a radio journalist in his late 20s who has a malignant tumour in his lumbar spine, is the main character. Adam makes the decision to organise his affairs after finding on the internet that his ailment has a 50/50 probability of survival with therapy. Along with dealing with the psychological effects of accepting his own death, he spends a lot of time with his closest buddy Kyle (Seth Rogen), makes peace with his mother, and begins to live life on his own terms. In the movie, Adam makes apologies with everyone he knows and indulges in hedonism for the first time in his life, much like Rodney did in “Living,” directed by Jonathan Levine.</p><h3>A Man Called Otto (2022)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a-man-called-otto-1.jpg alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" width=512 height=256 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Otto (<a href=#>Tom Hanks</a>) lost his wife half a year ago and is now a widower. The 63-year-old has grown increasingly angry and cynical during that time. Otto, who is about to retire, makes the decision to commit suicide, but his effort is repeatedly thwarted by his new neighbours Tommy (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), Marisol (Mariana Trevino), a young wife, and their two kids Abby (Alessandra Perez) and Luna (Christiana Montoya). The Marc Foster-directed film “A Man Called Otto” is based on the 2015 Swedish-language film “A Man Called Ove,” which in turn was based on Fredrik Backman’s 2012 novel of the same name. Otto, like Rodney, is unhappy with his life and tries to end it, but both of them learn a valuable lesson about friendship in the end.</p><h3></h3><h3>Departures (2008)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Departures.jpg alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" width=512 height=275 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A cellist named Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) returns to his village with his wife after losing his position with an orchestra in the drama movie “Departures.” Daigo stumbles onto a job posting while looking for a new position that asks for help with “departures.” Daigo submits an application for the position under the impression that it is for a travel agency but is surprised to learn that it is for an encoffiner, a person who prepares deceased people for their last rites. At first reluctant, Daigo accepts the job and finds comfort in being able to witness someone’s complete existence come to an end through his profession. The premise of “Living” and the Oscar-winning movie “Living,” which was directed by Yojiro Takita, is “discovering life near death, or through death.” Daigo and Rodney are both hopeless, but as they contemplate death, they start to value their lives.</p><h3></h3><h3>Last Orders (2001)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Last-Order.jpg alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" width=512 height=288 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After Jack Dodds (Michael Caine) passes away unexpectedly, the old south London butcher’s three lifelong friends and his adopted son come together to carry out his dying wish: to disperse his ashes at Margate, a seaside resort where Jack had once wanted to retire with his wife Amy (Helen Mirren). The four men reflect about Jack, the time they each spent with him as well as their time together, and the profound impact he had on each of their lives as they travel by road to Margate. The film “Last Orders,” which was directed by Fred Schepisi and is based on Graham Swift’s 1996 novel of the same name, places an emphasis on doing good deeds while one is still alive since, like “Living,” these good deeds will be remembered by all people long after one has passed away.</p><h3>The Angriest Man in Brooklyn (2014)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Angriest-Man-in-Brooklyn.jpg alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" width=500 height=282 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, directed by Phil Alden Robinson, centres on Henry Altmann, an elderly man with a temper. When he learns that he has a fatal brain aneurysm, Henry asks the doctor (Mila Kunis) how long he has to live in his explosive fashion. She abruptly informs him 90 minutes out of anger, which makes Henry storm off. Henry wants to make apologies with his entire family before he dies, including his wife, kid, and younger brother. He has alienated them all. The 92 Minutes of Mr. Baum (1997), an Israeli film that served as its inspiration, is similar to “Living” in that it also centres on a terminally ill man who discovers at the very last minute how much of his life he has missed as a result of his own resentment and bitterness.</p><h3></h3><h3>The Bucket List (2007)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Bucket-List.jpg alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" width=512 height=289 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) and the wealthy Edward Cole (<a href=#>Jack Nicholson</a>) are both given the prognosis of terminal lung cancer and wind up in the same hospital bed in Rob Reiner’s film “The Bucket List.” The two men talk about their lives to that point and their plans for the future there. Carter creates a similar bucket list, which Cold advises him to follow exactly, adding items of his own and offers to pay for the entire vacation. Much like Rodney in “Living,” Carter and Edward begin living their lives after learning they have terminal cancer.</p><h3>The Long Excuse (2016)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Long-Excuse-min.jpg alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" width=512 height=346 sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Long Excuse, a Japanese-language movie directed by Miwa Nishikawa and based on a book of the same name he wrote himself, is the story of a writer named Sachio Kinugasa (Masahiro Motoki), whose wife dies tragically in a bus <a href=#>accident</a>. Yoichi Omiya (Pistol Takehara), the widower of Sachio’s wife’s friend, who also died in the accident, contacts him shortly after her passing to let him know about his two children, whom he is finding it difficult to care for on his own in the wake of his wife’s untimely passing. Sachio, who is perplexed by his own indifference to the death of his wife, consents to assist Yoichi in rearing the kids. Sachio is a cynical writer who has lost all passion for life, much like Rodney in “Living,” and throughout the course of the novel, he steadily learns and changes his perspective.</p><h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Secret-Life-of-Walter-Mitty-min-e1686016274111.jpg alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" width=1243 height=588 sizes="(max-width: 1243px) 100vw, 1243px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The central character of “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” is Walter (Ben Stiller), a man stuck in a meaningless job at a magazine who daydreams of exciting adventures but never quite manages to take any. Walter is obliged to travel to Greenland, where photojournalist Sean O’Conner (Sean Penn), is last known to be, after one of his negative reels goes missing. This sets him off on an exciting voyage he could never have anticipated. The movie, which is based on James Thurber’s 1939 short story of the same name, is reminiscent to “Living” in the fact that Walter is forced to face life and how he lives it when his livelihood is in jeopardy, much like Rodney does near the end of his life.</p><h3></h3><h3></h3><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="movies that will change your life forever,best motivational movies hindi,deep movies about life,inspirational movies,real life inspirational movies,life changing movies for students,top 10 inspirational movies,movies that will change your life on netflix,movies like loving leah,movies you must watch in your life,movies you must watch in your lifetime,movies like love rosie and me before you" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
