Leaving boiled peanuts out at room temperature for more than 24 hours can cause them to go bad. Because of the high moisture content in cooked peanuts, they may degrade very fast. If you have any leftover boiled peanuts, you should store them in the refrigerator or freezer. When stored in the refrigerator, boiled peanuts should be safe to consume within 7 to 10 days.
