Benigno, and Anita Benigno-Kackle.</span></p><p><span>Also, it was reported that Joe looked a lot like his father who is no more in this world.</span></p><p><span>As for his hometown, Joe Benigno hails from Washington Township, Bergen County, New Jersey. He later moved to Tenafly, New Jersey; where he was living in 2021.</span></p><p><span>In light of his education, Joe attended </span><i><span>Westwood Regional High School</span></i><span> in Washington Township, New Jersey.</span></p><h3><b>Social Media Reach: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter</b></h3><p><span>By March 2021, Joe entertained 15.9K followers over her Instagram “@therealsuperjoe”.

But unlike him, Margaret wasn’t so happy about it, and it was because he followed female plumbers on social media. She said,&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I see him following these hot girls — they’re female plumbers. Cause they follow him. I’m like, relax! I don’t need these girls taking screenshots of Joe saying, ‘Hey, great pipes.’ It’s suspicious.

In Aug 2017, Joe took it to his IG to share a picture of his grandson named Mason.</span></p><p><span>Talking about his time on </span><i><span>RHONJ</span></i><span>, Joe was often seen sitting behind his wife at the reunions, and with other husbands if alone. And though he only got a little screen time, it didn’t stop him from becoming the fan’s favorite. According to RHO_Polls over Twitter, Joe was voted the most “favorite HW husband”, followed by Frank Catania, Joe Giudice, and Joe Benigno.</span></p><p><span>Little info about Margaret: Apart from being a reality star, Margaret was best recognized for having founded the </span><i><span>Macbeth Collection</span></i><span> lifestyle brand.
