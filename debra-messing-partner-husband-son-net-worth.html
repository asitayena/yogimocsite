Her late friend, Lori, was also the ex-wife of her former partner Will Chase.</span></p><p><span>She wrote a long message under the smiling photo of them and said,<strong> “I can’t believe you’re gone. No doubt, heaven has a new bright light. It's not fair. You're so good. So loving, funny, nurturing, loyal, open, optimistic, and ready to celebrate... anything. Ours was a unique bond. Lori was my ex-partner's ex-wife. Yes, that’s right. And the mother to 2 spectacular girls who I had the opportunity to fall in love with, and who became the sisters my boy never had.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She continued,<strong> “We loved each other’s children and in turn developed a beautiful friendship. We came to every school musical in Princeton, every kidz Theatre production, we went to Broadway musicals together, and she took them to Six Flags. It was special because it was entirely chosen. We sent singing happy birthday videos to each other, and she helped me celebrate my 50th birthday. We were chosen, family. Many, many hearts are shattered right now. Please say a prayer for her family. And remember, we are guaranteed nothing.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Will Chase, the ex-husband of Lori and Debra, also paid his condolences and stated,<strong> “We’re absolutely heartbroken by the passing of our sweet Lori. She was a great friend, mom, daughter, and companion. She was larger than life, and nothing will ever fill a room or a stage or our hearts like Lori.”</strong></span></p><h2><strong><span>Debra Messing Relationship With Will Chase</span></strong></h2><p><span>Debra Messing met Will Chase on the set of NBC musical drama, Smash and started dating in 2011. The Will & Grace star, Debra, had just separated from her husband of 10 years, Daniel Zelman when her new romance was out in public.</span></p><p><span>At the time, Will Chase also separated from his wife of two years, Stephanie Gibson.</span></p><p><span>However, the co-stars of Smash couple lasted only for two and a half years and separated in 2014. The actress’s rep told US magazine at the time, “Debra Messing and Will Chase have ended their two and a half year relationship but remain close friends.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Debra Messing Married Life With Ex-husband Daniel Zelman</span></strong></h2><p><span>Debra Messing met her ex-husband, Daniel Zelman, at New York University in the 1990s and got married in September 2000. They shared a son named Roman. They lasted for over a decade and called it quit in 2010. However, they remained together for the sake of their son for about a year in 2011.</span></p><p><span>At the time of their divorce, the actress asked for joint custody of their son and sought spousal and child support and shared in an interview how she was traumatized by her divorce and said, <strong>“Twenty years. It's a very long time. I think the institute of marriage is a noble thing. The idea of a partner for life is incredibly romantic. But now we’re living to 100. A hundred years ago, people were dying at age 37. Till death do us part was a much different deal.”</strong></span></p><p><span>She continued, <strong>“When I say the move to New York was traumatic, it was traumatic, it was traumatic because every aspect of my life was going through a huge change. Every thought is dictated by what’s best for our son. We are completely on the same page in that regard. We are dear friends. And I am at peace with the journey we’ve had. I feel like the 20 years we had together have been a huge success. And despite the fact that everything is changing, I think everyone is thriving. It's a new chapter in my personal life. I'm walking a path I've never walked before. But I'm optimistic.”</strong></span></p><p><span>The former couple continued to co-parent their son very well and said, <strong>“Now we are co-parenting beautifully. We had Thanksgiving together. In my mind, we will be a nuclear family forever.”</strong> the actress had shared a series of snaps from her vacation with her son, Roman in South East Asia in 2019 where her son looked all grown up and a lot like Debra actually.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Debra Messing</strong></span></h2><p><span>Debra Messing has an estimated net worth of $25 million, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.
