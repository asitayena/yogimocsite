Bad Bunny is known for his slurred vocal delivery style and his unique sense of style.</p><p>After gaining popularity on SoundCloud while living in Puerto Rico, Bad Bunny signed a record deal and released the breakthrough track "Soy Peor." He then gained even more notoriety by collaborating with <a href=# title="Drake Net Worth">Drake</a> and Cardi B on tracks like "I Like It" and "Mia." These chart-topping tracks propelled Bad Bunny into the spotlight, and this set the stage for the release of his debut album in 2018, entitled "X 100pre." He then collaborated with J Balvin to create the album "Oasis," which contained a number of additional smash hits.</p><p>By 2020, Bad Bunny was one of the most popular artists in the world.

Some of Benito's first experiences with music came when his mother played salsa, merengue, and ballads while he was growing up. Raised alongside two younger brothers, Benito later stated that he preferred to be at home with his family instead of out on the streets with friends.</p><p>Bad Bunny grew up in a strict Catholic household and sang in the choir until the age of 13. Although he abandoned singing in the choir, he quickly became inspired by artists like <a href=# title="Daddy Yankee Net Worth">Daddy Yankee</a>. Eventually, he began performing in front of his fellow students at middle school. At this point, he adopted the stage name "Bad Bunny" because of an old photo of him with an angry expression while being forced to wear a bunny outfit as a child.</p><p>While Benito was a shy high school student, he created freestyle raps and performed them in front of his peers as a joke. During this period, he also became passionate about skateboarding and professional wrestling. Despite receiving all kinds of different advice from various people about his post-secondary options, Bad Bunny knew that he wanted to go into music after graduating. One he left high school, he enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico and studied audiovisual communication.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-271080 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Bad-Bunny.jpg alt="Bad Bunny" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-271080 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Bad Bunny was working as a bagger at a grocery store while studying at university and releasing music on SoundCloud. Eventually, DJ Lucian noticed his song "Diles" and signed him to a record label called Hear this Music. Bad Bunny then collaborated with a production team known as the Mambo Kingz, who were immediately caught off guard by Bunny's unique sound and style of dress.</p><p>Over the next period, Bad Bunny successfully released multiple top-ten songs on the Latin Charts. Fueled by incredible streaming numbers and hundred of millions of views on YouTube, Bad Bunny eventually became one of the hottest artists in the Latin American trap scene. Songs like "Soy Peor," "Krippy Kush," and "Ahora Me Llama" helped him breakthrough as a mainstream artist.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-312375 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Bad-Bunny-1.jpg alt width=875 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-312375 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images)</p><p>In 2017, he signed more contracts and started appearing on television. Bad Bunny also collaborated heavily with other Latin artists like <a href=#>J Balvin</a>, <a href=#>Prince Royce</a>, and Ozuna. In 2018, he started to crossover into English-language music with "I Like It." The track featured <a href=#>Cardi B</a>, and Bunny raps in English, Spanglish, and Spanish. "I Like It" became his first chart-topping single, and it led to another collaboration with Drake: "Mia."</p><p>In 2018, Bad Bunny was ready to release his first studio album. This came shortly after he left Hear This Music and signed with Rimas Entertainment, as his previous record label was not contributing the production process, and they also prevented Bunny from releasing an album. "X 100pre" received strong reviews from critics, and he toured extensively over the next period.</p><p>Bad Bunny then followed up in 2019 with "Oasis," which was a collaboration with J Balvin. That year, he performed at Coachella. After appearing at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2020, Bunny released "YHLQMDLG," which is an acronym for "Yo hago lo que me da la gana." He was praised by critics for his versatility, and he followed up with a third album, "El Ultimo Tour Del Mundo," later that year, which took a lot of people by surprise. During the Covid-19 crisis, Bad Bunny released music with themes of isolation, quarantine, and anxiety.</p><p>In May 2022, Bad Bunny released his fourth studio album, "Un Verano Sin Ti," which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and remained there for 13 non-consecutive weeks. His World's Hottest Tour became the highest-grossing tour by a Latin artist in history, earning $232.5 million. Bad Bunny was named Artist of the Year at the Apple Music Awards 2022.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2017, Bad Bunny met Gabriela Berlingeri while dining at a restaurant with his family. The pair started dating, and over the next few years Gabriela became closely involved with his musical and professional development. She helped him record the song "Te Guste" by singing scratch vocals, and she also photographed him for the cover of "Rolling Stone." Bad Bunny has stated that Berlingeri offers him close emotional support at a time "when I needed it most."</p><p>In 2023, his ex-girlfriend Carliz Hernandez filed a $40 million lawsuit against the artist for unauthorized usage of her voice in various recordings.</p><p>Outside of music, Bad Bunny has ventured into the world of professional wrestling, making appearances in WWE over the years. He is a one-time WWE 24/7 Champion.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In January 2023, Bad Bunny paid $8.8 million for a mansion in the Hollywood Hills.
