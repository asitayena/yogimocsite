It all started when her older brother Kristof introduced her to CrossFit in 2014.</p><p>But she’s not just a powerhouse; she’s also got a strong family background in sports, with both her parents being PE teachers.</p><p>From those early days to becoming a star in CrossFit, Horvath’s journey is about hard work and having her family cheering her on.</p><p>Get to know the details about the talented athlete and her supportive family here!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Laura Horvath’s biography- Know her height, weight & age</h2><p>Horvath, born on March 21, 1997, in Budapest, is a 26-year-old CrossFit Athlete. She stands at a height of 1.70 meters (5.6 feet) and weighs 70 kilograms (150 pounds).</p><p>Hailing from Hungary, Horvath has made a name for herself in the world of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CrossFit</a> through her dedication and skill.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Her journey as an athlete began in Budapest, where she trained and honed her abilities. Over time, Horvath’s hard work paid off, as she has become a prominent figure in the CrossFit world.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Laura Horvath won the 2023 CrossFit Games</h3><p>Horvath’s journey in CrossFit started because of her brother Kristof in 2014. He introduced her to this whole CrossFit thing, and little did she know, she was stepping into something that would change her life.</p><p>The following year, in 2015, she jumped into her first CrossFit competition and managed to nab the fourth spot – not bad for a rookie!</p><p>But it was 2017 that really marked a turning point. Horvath gained attention by coming in second at the Dubai Fitness Championship, and that’s when people started noticing her serious CrossFit skills.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Fast forward to 2023, and the Hungarian athlete had been through ups and downs – injuries, challenges, and more.</p><p>Then came the CrossFit Games, the big showdown. She wasn’t leading at the start, but she turned things around.</p><p>In the last stretch, she won three events in a row and snatched her first-ever CrossFit Games championship.</p><p>That’s not all. Horvath has a collection of medals – two silvers from 2018 and 2021 and a bronze from 2022. Now, she’s titled as “the fittest woman on earth.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Laura Horvath is not married</h2><p>The 26-year-old CrossFit star isn’t married and doesn’t have a husband. There are no updates about her planning to get married anytime soon.</p><p>She’s kept her personal stuff pretty low-key, even her dating life. If you check out her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>, you won’t spot any lovey-dovey posts.</p><p>It looks like she’s all about her career and passions right now. She’s putting all her energy into being awesome at CrossFit.</p><p>So, at least for now, wedding bells might not be ringing for her as she stays super focused on her goals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meet Laura Horvath’s Family</h2><p>Horvath’s family is pretty awesome. Her mom, Emese Szöllősi, and dad, Ernő Horváth, are both physical education teachers from Budapest, Hungary.</p><p>Laura has two brothers, an older one named Kristof and a younger one named Botond.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Laura-Horvath-biography.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-cyan-bluish-gray-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Laura Horvath with her brothers.

None are catching the eye more than Jevon Holland. The 23-year-old Coquitlam-born safety was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 2021 after impressing in two seasons of college football with the Oregon Ducks.</p><p>Holland has not looked back ever since, establishing himself as a regular in the Dolphins team, posting some serious tackle and interception figures.</p><p>In fact, Holland is now the starting free safety position for Miami. So far in 2023, Holland has registered 44 solo tackles, just four shy of the 48 he amassed in his entire debut season in 2021.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland and the Dolphins are in great shape for a 2024 Super Bowl bid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Laura-Horvath-siblings1.jpg><p>Holland could be celebrating winning his first Lombardi Trophy next year too if the bookmakers’ odds are to be believed. The Dolphins are currently rated as +800 fifth favorites to land the 2024 Super Bowl with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Ontario-licensed sports betting online operator Betano</a>, which has served the Canadian province since receiving its license in October 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Holland’s first ever NFL touchdown was a big one – in more ways than one!</h2><p>Holland played a key role in the Dolphins’ recent victory over the New York Jets. Holland completed a stunning interception of a hail Mary pass, before returning it with interest for a stunning 99-yard touchdown. It was the first touchdown of Holland’s NFL career and it steered Miami to a comfortable 34-13 victory.</p><p>It’s a win which keeps Miami firmly top of the AFC East. In fact, only the Baltimore Ravens have made a better start to the 2023-24 NFL season in the AFC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The British Columbian safety did more than assist the Dolphins in their quest for victory over the Jets that day. His full-field return triggered an eagerly anticipated giveaway worth over $1 million. During the NFL preseason, electronics firm TCL launched its “Ultimate Gameday Upgrade” committing to give away $1 million worth of 98” televisions if a player managed to score a touchdown from a minimum of 98 yards in.</p><p>Holland beat the minimum by a single yard. TCL also made sure Holland received a 98” TV too, as reward for his feat.</p><p>Holland has missed the last few games for the Dolphins after sustaining a sprain to his medial ligaments in both knees. This disappointing injury was suffered in the same game as his majestic touchdown against the Jets.</p><p>The team continues to use kid gloves with Holland, pushing him only sparingly into team practice. Holland himself admits <a href=# rel=noopener>he’s “taking his time” with his rehab</a> to ensure he returns at the peak of his powers.</p><p>The Dolphins realize just how important Holland has become to their defense, as he also serves as the quarterback of the secondary. Head coach Mike McDaniel described Holland as being “diligent” with his recovery, especially with the chance of a deep postseason run looming.</p><p><strong>Holland’s path to NFL stardom</strong></p><p>Miami is reaping the rewards of recognizing Holland’s undoubted potential in the NFL after making him their second-round pick of the 2021 NFL Draft. Holland had impressed during his scholarship with the Oregon Ducks in the <a href=#>same way as outside linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux</a>, who was later recruited by the New York Giants.</p><p>Holland’s rookie season saw him display his physical prowess from day one. He exhibited a rare combination of athleticism, football intelligence, and a knack for disrupting opposing offenses. His ability to cover ground in the secondary, make crucial tackles, and create turnovers has earned him rave reviews from Dolphins fans and respect from his peers across the league.</p><p>Beyond his on-field contributions, Holland’s leadership qualities and adaptability have also been noteworthy. Whether patrolling the backfield or contributing on special teams, Holland has quickly established himself as a versatile asset to the Dolphins.</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Congrats to the couple!</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Santi-Aldama-Girlfriend.jpg alt="Santi Aldama Is Getting Married to His Girlfriend Pilar Barquin" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Santi Aldama is a Spanish professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association’s (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA</a>) Memphis Grizzlies.</p><p>Before being drafted into the NBA, he was a Loyola Greyhounds basketball player in college.

He scored his career high in February 2023 and got engaged to his girlfriend in September 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Santi Aldama’s relationship with future wife and dating history</h2><p>Aldama has been dating his girlfriend, Pilar Barquin, for quite some time. He is very secretive about his personal life, so he has not revealed anything about his dating history or his past relationships.</p><p>As a result of his privacy, it’s unknown if he had dated anyone before he began dating his future wife. Similarly, the details of his relationship with his girlfriend-turned-fiancee are not known. It is unknown when the duo first met or how they started dating.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, it looks like they have been together before the summer of 2021. Barquin first posted her boyfriend on Instagram in July 2021.</p><p>She <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/CR9rgfkr52b/?img_index=1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> a series of photos with his with the caption, “un día más admirándote y sintiéndome la persona más afortunada del mundo!! Enhorabuena,” which roughly translates to “One more day admiring you and feeling like the luckiest person in the world!! Congratulations.”</p><p>Since then, Barquin has been more comfortable sharing photos of her boyfriend on her social media. On the other hand, Aldama first posted about his girlfriend and revealed that he was dating Barquin in May 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Since they have been dating, Aldama and his girlfriend have celebrated Christmas together with their family. After dating for at least two years, the duo got engaged in September 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nfl.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Santi Aldama might get married to his girlfriend soon.

Aldama has not referred to Barquin as his wife, and neither has Barquin referred to the athlete as her husband.</p><p>So, it looks like the two are not married yet but might be planning for their dream wedding. For now, fans of the NBA star will have to wait patiently to see their favorite player share the wedding vows with his partner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Santi Aldama’s family and career</h2><p>Aldama was raised in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Gran Canaria, Spain. He began playing basketball at the age of three because of his family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He was inspired by his own family, especially his father, Santiago, who played professional basketball in Spain and Portugal before joining the Spanish national team in the 1992 Summer Olympics.

He was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lured</a> to the school because his father knew assistant coach Ivo Simovi and because Aldama hoped to one day work in business, and he felt at ease when he visited in June 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Many analysts were surprised by Aldama’s decision to play for a mid-major program as he was considered a four-star recruit and a high-major player.&nbsp;</p><p>Aldama was out for the first three months of his rookie season due to a knee ailment that necessitated surgery. On February 1, 2020, he made his college debut for Loyola Maryland, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">scoring</a> 11 points in 17 minutes in a 79-73 win over Navy.</p><p>In four weeks, Aldama was voted Patriot League Rookie of the Week three times.
